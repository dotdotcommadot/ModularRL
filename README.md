ModularRL
=========

A basic example of a modular application built with Flex 4.9 and Robotlegs 2.

!!! Important !!!: 
Make sure to use with at least Robotlegs 2.0.0b4. 
This version introduces the stageCrawler extension, 
which "checks for views that might already be on the stage after context initialization
and ensures that those views are handled."
